# TUBITAK Algorithm Design Internship 

During my internship, I developed two algorithms.

The first was the City Explorer Algorithm (DFS-based). This project aims to find the longest possible path connecting cities in TÃ¼rkiye, where each connection (edge) is between 150 and 250 km. 
The algorithm builds a graph based on these distance constraints and searches for the longest valid path within that graph. And I used several data structures in this project, including a Static Vector, and an Object Pool to optimize memory usage and performance.
