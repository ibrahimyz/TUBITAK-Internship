# TUBITAK Algorithm Design Internship 

During my internship, I developed two algorithms in C++.

The first was the **City Explorer Algorithm** (DFS-based). This project aims to find the longest possible path connecting cities in TÃ¼rkiye, where each connection (edge) is between 150 and 250 km. 
The algorithm builds a graph based on these distance constraints and searches for the longest valid path within that graph. And I used several data structures in this project, including a Static Vector, and an Object Pool to optimize memory usage and performance.

The second was the **Bus Scheduling Algorithm**, which finds the buses that arrive at a bus stop based on a predefined timetable. I also created the timetable in periodGenerator.h, which generates periodic schedules for the buses. Then, using these intervals, I found the buses that arrive at a specific stop based on the timetable. In this project, I used a Static Vector for efficient memory management and a custom split algorithm for parsing time data.
